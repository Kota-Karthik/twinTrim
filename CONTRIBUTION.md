## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:**
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page to create your own copy of the project.
   - Clone your fork locally using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git
     ```

2. **Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:**
   - It’s a good practice to create a separate branch for each contribution:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name
     ```

3. **Make your changes:**
   - Implement your changes or fixes.
   - Ensure your code adheres to the [Coding Standards](#coding-standards) described below.
   - Test thoroughly to make sure your contribution doesn’t break any existing features.

4. **Commit your changes:**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages as outlined in the [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) section.
   - Stage and commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Brief explanation of your changes"
     ```

5. **Push your branch to GitHub:**
   - Push the branch to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-or-bugfix-name
     ```

6. **Submit a pull request (PR):**
   - Go to the original repository and submit a pull request from your fork.
   - Fill out the PR template and include details about the changes you’ve made.

## Coding Standards

- **Consistency:** Follow the existing code style of the project.
- **Indentation:** Use 2/4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- **Naming Conventions:** Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and methods. Follow `snake_case` for functions and variables, and `CamelCase` for classes.
- **Comments:** Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic or decisions.
- **Testing:** Ensure your changes pass all tests and add new tests if required.

## Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for writing clear and helpful commit messages:

1. Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
2. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixes bug").
3. Keep messages concise but descriptive.
4. Reference issues or PRs if applicable (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Issue Reporting

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, check if it has already been reported.
2. **Provide Detailed Information:** Include steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, screenshots if necessary, and any relevant logs.
3. **Label the Issue:** Use appropriate labels to classify the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement, question).

## Pull Requests

1. **One PR, One Feature:** Ensure that each PR is focused on a single feature or bug fix.
2. **Description:** Clearly explain the purpose of the PR, the changes made, and any relevant issues that it addresses.
3. **Review and Tests:** Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers. Ensure that all automated tests pass before submitting your PR.
4. **Keep it Simple:** Try to keep your PR small and focused to make reviewing easier and faster.
