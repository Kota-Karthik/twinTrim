# Code of Conduct

## My Pledge

As the owner and maintainer of the **TwinTrim** project, I am committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone involved. Whether you are contributing code, writing documentation, submitting issues, or participating in discussions, I am dedicated to ensuring that the **TwinTrim** community remains a positive and collaborative space for individuals of all ages, body sizes, visible or invisible disabilities, cultural backgrounds, ethnicities, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationalities, personal appearances, races, religions, or sexual identities and orientations.

I believe that the strength of the **TwinTrim** project is built on the diversity of perspectives and the collaborative nature of the community. I am actively committed to promoting an atmosphere where everyone feels respected, valued, and heard.

## Standards of Behavior

To help create a positive, productive, and welcoming environment, I expect all participants in the **TwinTrim** project to uphold the following standards of behavior:

### Positive and Respectful Behavior

- **Use inclusive language**: Refrain from discriminatory or exclusionary language. Communications should be accessible and easy to understand for all participants.
- **Respect differing viewpoints and experiences**: Recognize that others may have different ideas or experiences, and diverse perspectives make the project better.
- **Accept constructive feedback gracefully**: Feedback is an important part of collaboration. Embrace it with an open mind and focus on improvement.
- **Focus on the well-being of the project and community**: Prioritize the interests of the project and support fellow contributors.
- **Show empathy**: Be kind and understanding. Offer support to those who may need it, acknowledging that others may have personal challenges.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Behaviors that violate the values of respect, inclusivity, and professionalism are unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Sexualized language or imagery**: Including inappropriate jokes, comments, or imagery that can make others uncomfortable. Unwelcome advances or attention based on gender are strictly prohibited.
- **Trolling and derogatory comments**: Verbal attacks, personal insults, or inflammatory comments intended to provoke, belittle, or demean others are unacceptable.
- **Harassment**: Any form of public or private harassment, bullying, repeated unsolicited communication, or attempts to intimidate are not tolerated.
- **Publishing private information**: Sharing someone’s personal details, such as their contact information, without their explicit consent is prohibited.
- **Unprofessional conduct**: Any behavior that is inappropriate in a professional or collaborative setting, including threats or actions that compromise the project’s integrity, will not be tolerated.
